## Features

- Driver and constructor standings with F1-style tie-breakers
- Sprint points included in totals while race-only statistics remain accurate
- Championship progression, lead changes, momentum, and form tables
- Latest-race dashboard and calendar status
- Circuit win records and all-time title counts
- English and Portuguese interface
- Persistent dark and light themes
- Explicit workbook validation with actionable error messages

## Run locally

Python 3.11 is recommended.

```powershell
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m streamlit run app.py
```

The app automatically loads `F1_Standings.xlsx` from the repository root. It also searches the `data`, `Data`, `assets`, and `excel` directories when the default file is absent.

## Workbook format

The workbook must contain a worksheet named `Leagues` with these columns:

| Column | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `Game` | Game/version name |
| `Season` | Season label, such as `2026-T02` |
| `League Name` | League identifier |
| `Round` | Numeric round, or `All` for a season total |
| `GP Name` | Grand Prix name, or `All`/`Season Final` for a season total |
| `Driver` | Driver or player name |
| `Team` | Constructor name |
| `Finish Pos` | Numeric finishing position |
| `Points` | Numeric points earned |

An optional `Type` column accepts `R` for a race and `SR` for a sprint. Unknown values are treated as races.

The optional `Calendar` worksheet supports:

- `League Name`
- `Round`
- `Date`
- `GP Name`
- `Circuit`
- `Status`
- `Time (Lisbon)`

If `Calendar` is missing, standings remain available and the app displays a schedule-feature warning. Missing required sheets or columns, blank identifiers, invalid rounds, and non-numeric results stop loading with a clear message.

## Scoring behavior

- Points from race and sprint rows are added to championship totals.
- Wins, podiums, top-five finishes, average finish, and consistency use main-race rows only.
- Standings tie-break order is points, wins, podiums, average finish, then name.
- When race-level rows and season-total rows coexist, race-level rows are used to prevent double counting.
- Seasons with upcoming calendar entries are excluded from completed-title counts.

## Quality checks

Run the automated checks with:

```powershell
python -m unittest discover -s tests -v
python -m py_compile app.py dashboard_core.py puskas_html.py
```

The GitHub Actions workflow runs these checks and performs a minimal Streamlit startup test for every push and pull request.

## Project structure

- `app.py` — Streamlit interface and visual presentation
- `dashboard_core.py` — workbook validation, normalization, and standings calculations
- `puskas_html.py` — custom dashboard HTML rendering
- `tests/` — calculation and workbook regression tests
- `assets/` — optimized WebP dashboard imagery
